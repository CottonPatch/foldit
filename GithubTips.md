Perform the github-slideshow tutorial, with the following steps:
1) Create github.com account billybobbobrownjr
2) While on github.com, clone github-slideshow to my billybobbobrownjr github account 
3) Install VS-2019 or VS-Code
4) Within VS-2019, clone my github.com copy of github-slideshow to my local machine into c:\users\bcotton\source\repos\billybobbobrownjr\github-slideshow
5) Within VS-2019, create a branch from master called my-slide
6) Within VS-2019, "push" the my-slide branch declaration to my github.com copy of github-slideshow
7) Within VS-2019, add a new file (slide) called 0000-01-02-billybobbobrownjr.md to the local my-slide branch.
8) Within VS-2019, commit the change to the local github-slideshow repos. 
   I believe this is the equivalent of "add new file to version control database at the my-slide branch" and is the
   file's first history entry in the local github-slideshow repos. This file is still not in the local master branch
   of the github-slideshow repos and also is not yet on github.com.
9) Within VS-2019, create pull request to ask if new file can be merged from local my-slide branch to local master branch
   
Let's recap the git commands:  
2) Clone on server  
4) Clone on local  
5) Branch on local  
6) Push branch to server  
8) Commit new file to local
