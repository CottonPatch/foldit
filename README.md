# foldit
Make the following changes to Lua scripts for foldit puzzles:
1) Add changes to make it easier for new users to learn foldit and lua scripting
2) Make variable names and function names easier to understand their purpose
3) Increase spacing for older eyes (sigh)
4) Add in-line documentation
5) Assume user has very little prior knowledge of foldit or Lua scripting (like me a few months ago)
6) Add debug functions with random return value generation for debugging locally (also as a learning aide)

Tips: 
1) Download and install ZeroBrane Studio to learn how to write and debug Lua scripts, including the Rebuild2020.Lua script.
2) Only install Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code if you want to be frustrated.
3) Although you can debug Lua scripts in VS Code, with a plug-in, it crashes often.
4) You cannot debug lua scripts in VS 2019, but you can edit the script files and check in changes to GitHub directly from VS 2019 (that's what I am doing).
5) Although ZeroBrane Studio is an awesome Lua development environment, it does not have version control abilities, not even with plug-ins.
