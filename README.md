# foldit
Lua scripts for foldit puzzles <-- Yes, exactly! This is it! I already added this comment/description to the "Foldit" repos. So why repeat it here. Did I not explain it well enough with my comment? Oh, by the way, this is a readme file. It's basically useless at this point. But, who knows, maybe it will make sense later since I will know more later, no?

Where did  my commit comment go for this file?
