Purpose: To enhance existing Lua "recipe" scripts for foldit puzzles.  

So far I have:  

1) Added tons of comments and documentation to make it easier to learn foldit scripting and lua coding in general.  
2) Changed names of variables and functions to more easily understand their purpose.  
3) Increase code spacing to allow easier viewing (especially for those of us over 40 years old).  
4) Add debug functions with random return value generation for debugging locally (also as a learning aide).  

Tips:  

1) Download and install ZeroBrane Studio to learn how to write and debug Lua scripts, including the Rebuild2020.Lua script.  
2) Only install Visual Studio 2019 (VS-2019) or Visual Studio Code (VS-Code) if you want to be frustrated.  
3) Although you can debug Lua scripts in VS-Code (with a free plug-in) it crashes often.  
4) You cannot debug lua scripts in VS-2019, but you can check in changes to GitHub directly from VS-2019 (that's what I am doing).  
5) Although ZeroBrane Studio is an awesome Lua development environment, it does not have built-in version control abilities. Also,  presently, I am not aware of any version control plug-ins available for ZeroBrane Studio)
